# 1.2 Release Notes

## Maps

Maps has undergone a major set of improvements, mostly internal, but the following
changes should be noted:

 * Instead of GeoJSON files, we are now using the more efficient topoJSON format.
   (https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki). This makes maps download speed much
   faster

 * The `map` command now accepts an option parameter for the level of detail of the
   map polygons. The possible values are `high`, `medium`, and `low` with medium being
   the default. In general, `medium` assumes a 800x800 pixel display space with about
   10x zooming still looking good. `low` assumes a smaller space with very little
   zooming (but the zooming is way faster!) and `high` is as much detail as we have
   available.

 * We have improved the name look up routines so they now accept a much wider
   choice of names for a country, including non-english names.

 * Axes for maps are supported and generate a graticule for the map. The number of
   divisions is dynamically calculated

 * Look has improved

## Labels

 * Labels are now automatically thinned so they are not shown all on top of each other.   This is dynamic, so as you zoom in, more labels will be shown if now possible

## Notebooks

Some of the changes in version 1.2 may cause graphs in existing notebooks to not appear immediately. If this happens try executing all cells, then reloading the browser page.  There may be other issues when upgrading.  More information and work-arounds are in [this git issue](https://github.com/Brunel-Visualization/Brunel/issues/98)

* Python:  Added support for pandas DataFrame index.  If the index has a label, it can be referenced in the Brunel as a field.
* Toree:  Update to magic now requires Toree dev8 or later

## Miscellaneous

* `filter()` may now  contain default values for each field.  See "Interactivity" section in online documentation for examples.
*  Added new action to add graph titles and footnotes:  `title("A Title")`.  See "Titles, Guides and Style" section in online docs.
*  Animated entrances in new `effect()` command.  See "Interacivity" section of online docs.

## Integrators

* Note that a new JS file is required:  `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/topojson/1.6.20/topojson.min.js`
