<H1>Aesthetics</H1>

<p>
    "Aesthetics" is the term we give to commands that modify properties of the graphical object that are not
    related to position. Currently Brunel supports <code>color</code> and <code>size</code> aesthetics. Also included in
    this section is the <code>split</code> command, which is really more of a data grouping construct, but it acts
    in many ways like an aesthetic.
</p><p>
    When we use a field as an aesthetic, it has a significant side effect; the data is split into
    groups, one for each value of that aesthetic. Multiple aesthetics make groups based on the combinations of values.
    For elements that show one shape for each data row, that makes no difference, but for elements (like area and line)
    that aggregate multiple rows of data into one shape, it makes a strong difference. For this reason, when using
    aggregating elements, it is common to use categorical fields for aesthetics. Alternatively, we can bin a
    numeric field to ensure it has fewer different values.
</p>

<h3>Color</h3>
<p>
    Color is probably the most used aesthetic. When we map a field to
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(winter) x(winter) y(summer) style("size:200%")</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(region) x(winter) y(summer) style("size:200%")</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(winter) x(winter) y(summer) bin(winter)
    style("size:200%")</a></p>
<p>
    In the above examples, you can see that the mapping from field to color is dependent on the type of the field.
    There are three different classes of mapping used:
<ul>
    <li><b>nominal</b>: Used by default for categorical data, this mapping has no order and tries to create a spread of
        different hues to distinguish as many different hues as possible.
    </li>
    <li><b>diverging</b>: Used by default for most numeric data, this mapping assumes that high and low values are of
        interest and so creates a two-ended color range that highlights those values
    </li>
    <li><b>sequential</b>: Used for counts and binned data, this mapping goes from low to high with one range of color
    </li>
</ul>
You can explicitly request the type of mapping you want to use, as shown below:
</p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(winter:nominal) bar x(winter) y(#count) bin(winter)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(winter:diverging) bar x(winter) y(#count) bin(winter)</a>
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(winter:sequential) bar x(winter) y(#count) bin(winter)</a>
</p>

<p>
    For detailed color mapping specification, you can specify a sequential scale by name (<i>Greens</i>,
    <i>PurpleBlues</i>,<i>BlueGreens</i>,<i>Reds</i>,<i>Purples</i>,<i>GreenYellows</i>,<i>BlueYellows</i>,<i>Browns</i>).
    Note that these are all <b>plural</b> -- they define a carefully designed scale that is generally close to the hues
    defined in the name.
</p><p>
    You can also specify a simple scale going from white to a defined color by specifying the CSS name of the color,
    or the #RRGGBB code:
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(winter:Blue) x(winter) y(summer) style("size:200%")</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(winter:black) x(winter) y(summer) style("size:200%")</a>
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(winter:#800800) x(winter) y(summer) style("size:200%")</a>
</p>
<p>
    For more control, you can specify one or more colors (or palettes) that are combined together. The produces
    a set of colors for category data, and for numeric data defines a scale.  You can also add in runs of asterisks
    to mute the colors more than normal, or `=` to remove default muting for area elements. The standard syntax for a
    list of colors is `[color1,color2, ... ,colorN]`, but we also allow `color1-color2-...-colorN` as a simpler style,
    especially for divergent color scales.
</p>
<p>
    By default, when you ask for a divergent palette (2 colors) a scale is created that runs through a neutral
    color in the middle. This usually produces a more easily interpretable color scale, but the method can be defeated
    by specifying a three color scale and using the special middle color `none`, which will then create a simple
    color interpolation from the lower to the upper value:
</p>
<p>
    Here are some examples for a numeric field:
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(winter:black-yellow) x(winter) y(summer) style("size:200%")</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(winter:[black,yellow]) x(winter) y(summer) style("size:200%")</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer) color(winter:[white, black, yellow]) style('size:200%')</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer) color(winter:[magenta, lime]) style('size:200%')</a>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer) color(winter:[magenta, none, lime]) style('size:200%')</a>
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer) color(winter:[magenta, lime, **]) style('size:200%')</a>
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer) color(winter:[black, nominal]) style('size:200%')</a>
</p>
And here are some examples for a categorical field
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(region:black-yellow) x(winter) y(summer) style("size:200%")</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer) color(region:[gray,gray,red,gray,gray,blue]) style('size:200%')</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer) color(region:[gray, gray, red, gray, gray, blue]) style('size:200%')</a>
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer) color(region:[blues]) style('size:200%')</a>
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer) color(region:[#aaaaaa,#888888,nominal]) style('size:200%')</a>
</p>


<p>As described above, aesthetics interact with the element type. Because elements such as lines need one color only,
    when we use color on such an element, it splits into pieces, one for each "group" created by the aesthetic.

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">line x(winter) y(summer) color(region)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">polygon x(winter) y(summer) color(region)</a></p>

<p>
    Currently, only the first color field is used. In the future, we will enhance this so that if two fields are set,
    the first is used for HUE, and the second for SATURATION and BRIGHTNESS. When three fields are used, they
    will set the red, green and blue components.
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">color(region, #count) x(summer) size(#count) bin(summer)
    bubble</a></p>

<H3>Opacity</H3>
<p>
    Opacity sets how transparent the graphic is; zero means fully transparent and one means fully opaque.
    An optional parameter on the opacity sets the <i>low</i> value of the opacity -- the high value on the
    range is always 1. Opacity is very useful in conjunction with <code>#selection</code> to draw attention
    to the selected items, as shown in the examples
</p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(longitude) y(latitude) style('size:600%; stroke:none') opacity(population:0) color(region) legends(none)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">chord x(boys_name) y(girls_name) color(girls_name) legends(none) interaction(select:mouseover) opacity(#selection)</a></p>

<H3>Size</H3>
<p>
    The size aesthetic works very similarly to color, except it modifies the size of the element.
    Instead of specifying lists of colors, lists of sizes can be specified. If only a single size is specified
    then a scale is cterated going from 5% to that defined size.
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">point x(state) y(density) size(density)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">point x(state) y(density) size(density) style("size:200%")</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">point x(state) y(density) size(density:1000%)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">point x(state) y(density) size(density:500%-0%-1000%)</a></p>
<p>
    <code>Size</code> works differently for different elements; point elements can be sized as you would expect; bars
    are sized on their widths only (so <code>width</code> and <code>size</code> have the same effect.
    Edges have their stroke sizes modified. Lines and Paths become filled objects with
    varying widths. Size has no effect on areas and polygons.
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">point x(state) y(density) size(density)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">bar x(region) y(density) size(#count) mean(density) label(#count)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">line x(state) y(density) size(region)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">line x(state) y(density) size(region:400)</a></p>
<p>
    Size can also take two fields. For this definition the two fields modify width and height, so this way of specifying
    size is most suited to a point element with a rectangle type.
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(longitude) y(latitude) size(population, density) style('symbol:rect; size:300%')</a></p>


<H3>Split</H3>
<p>
    The split aesthetic does not modify the appearance of items at all -- all it does is to split up a single item (like
    an area)into multiple ones. Effectively it is used just for creating groups. Multiple fields can be used to split by
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">polygon x(winter) y(summer) split(region)</a></p>
