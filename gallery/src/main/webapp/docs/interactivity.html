<H1>Interactivity</H1>

<p>
    Brunel allows a number of interactive features.
    If not specified, some interactivity is available by default, but, as always, specifying what is wanted will
    force that option.
    Note that interactivity is specified on a per-chart basis, so each chart can have a different mode of use.
</p>


<h3>Pan/Zoom</h3>
<p>
    By default this is set <b>on</b>, but  will only apply to <i>numeric</i> dimensions of charts that do not specify a diagram.
    When this feature is active, a chart can be panned and zoomed by dragging or double-clicking on any <b>blank</b> area of the chart.
    Holding down the shift key while double-clicking zooms the chart out instead of in.
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">text x(winter) y(summer) tooltip(state, region) label(abbr)</a>
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(latitude) y(summer) | x(latitude) y(winter)
    interaction(none)</a>
</p>
<p>
    This parameter takes the options <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>xy</code>,<code>none</code>, ,<code>none</code>
    which allow control over exactly which dimensions can be panned or zoomed.
</p>

<h3>Selection</h3>
<p>
    Each data set has a special field <code>"#selection"</code> that can be used in the same way as any other field --
    for color, coordinates, etc. In general this feature not be useful unless you have multiple charts and at least one
    of
    them states that they use selection interactivity. When clicking on elements of that chart, those selections
    will then be propagated through to the other charts in that system. You can modify the selection to make it
    apply to different events by adding an event parameter <code>interaction(select:<i>event</i>)</code>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>click</b> -- the default, fired when an element is clicked on</li>
    <li><b>mouseover</b> -- fired when an element is moved on top of</li>
    <li><b>mousemove</b> -- fired continuously as the mouse moves over an element</li>
    <li><b>mouseout</b> -- fired when the mouse leaves an element</li>
    <li><b>snap</b> -- this is a special event that is fired when the mouse moves over the chart, and
    "sufficiently close" to an item. Variants "snapX" and "snapY" are used to measure distance only in one dimension,
    and an optional numeric parameter allows the sufficient distance to be specified in pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>

    Selection takes on two possible values, an 'x' for unselected and a check mark for selected. One common use case is
    to map the value to color to show the selected parts from one chart as highlighted in the other chart.
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer) color(#selection) size(#selection:200%) |
    y(region) size(#count) interaction(select:mouseover) color(#selection) x('') axes(none)
    label(region) sort(#count:ascending)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">treemap x(region, presidential_choice) tooltip(#all)
    size(population) color(#selection) label(abbr) | bar x(boys_name) y(#count) stack color(#selection)
    interaction(select) transpose axes(x) | bar x(girls_name) axes(x) y(#count) stack color(#selection)
    interaction(select) color(#selection) transpose axes(x) legends(none) stack</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">line x(winter) y(summer) + x(winter) y(summer)
    size(#selection:200%) label(summer) style('.label:not(.selected) {visibility:hidden}')
    interaction(select:snapx:1000)</a></p>

<h3>Interaction(filter)</h3>
<p>
    Instead of using the<code>#selection</code> field as a regular field, it can also be used to filter the data
    going into the chart, by specifying <code>interaction(filter)</code>.
</p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(boys_name) y(girls_name) label(#count) interaction(filter) |
    bar y(population) stack color(#selection) split(region) sort(population) label(region) sum(population)
    interaction(select)</a></p>

<h3>Filter</h3>
<p>
    The <code>filter</code> command is an interaction command which will create one or more interactive controls
    (sliders, check boxes, ...) beside the visualization and allow dynamic filtering using those items. As is true
    for all interactivity, the filtering happens client-side and sorting and summarization happen afterwards and
    so will respect the filtered data.  Default filter values may be provided as attributes to the fields used for
    filtering.
</p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(population) y(violent_crimes) color(dem_rep) size(water:600%)
    filter(presidential_choice, water)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(population) y(violent_crimes) color(dem_rep) size(water:600%)
    filter(Region:[Pacific, South], water:6-65)</a></p>

<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>
    The <code>animate</code> command will create an interactive control that animates over the values of a continuous field.
    The button will pause or continue the animation and it will automatically loop back to the beginning.  When
    the animation is paused, the slider may be used as a regular filter.  A numeric option on the field name requests a
    desired number of animation frames.  Note the results may not have exactly this number of frames depending on the data.
    The number of milliseconds between frames may be controlled using the <code>speed</code> option.
</p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">data('sample:Unemployment.csv') bar x(Period) y(Women)
 animate(Year:10, speed:200) mean(Women)</a></p>


<h3>Effects</h3>
<p>
    Although technically not interactivity, an effect is a usually animated feature of a visualization.
    In Brunel, we have define one simple effect so far, which animates the first appearance of a chart. It
    will only operate for single chart visualizations, and animates the size, y value or color if it finds a
    numeric field defined for that role. Otherwise this effect is ignored.
</p>
<p>
    Use the command <code>effect(enter)</code> to request an entrance animation. An optional time parameter
    in milliseconds allows the speed of the animation to be controlled, like this: <code>effect(enter:1200)</code>
</p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(region) y(violent_crimes) size(population:1000%) effect(enter)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">bar x(region) y(violent_crimes) sum(violent_crimes) effect(enter:5000)</a></p>
